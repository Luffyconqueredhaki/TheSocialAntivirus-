# TheSocialAntivirus-
-The purpose of this project is to learn, because we have learnt a lot, but still not enough, and because it was born for this therefore:

-If you are a #Penetration tester: you can add similar viruses to the DB and attack the virtual machine with increasingly complex backdoors and not have them detected by either the DB or the Machine Learning model!

-If you are a beginner and like #CyberSecurity you can see how a basic antivirus is structured, modify it, replicate its functions and understand the dynamics!

-If you want to create your own Antivirus because you have enough of them selling your data here is a good basis!

IN SHORT DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH IT! 

The AI certainly helped us to understand the more complex errors, but it is really important for me to have learnt a lot and that my friends did too. 
The centrality of this project, is that it can in turn be used to learn, and if we even help someone, we have created value.
I don't know when we might publish the next versions, keep it up and feel like #improving it! That in the end the spirit of open source and shared learning is nothing but that!
